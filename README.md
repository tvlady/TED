Turbomachinery prEliminary Design

This code allows the user to design a jet engine compressor using basic inputs. The code will generate velocity triangles, a flow path drawing, a drawing of the mean line rotor airfoil and more. 
To run this code, download the repository, make your own _vars file and run the file called "compressor_test". Ensure you are importing the correct file at the top.

See the User manual for specifics.
